# Notion Academic Website

This repo is forked from [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit)
by [@transitive-bullshit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit). You can find how to set up config
values in `site.config.ts`, and how to run and deploy this project to Vercel there.

## Demo

My [site](https://www.wenhanlyu.com/) - currently on the `main` branch.

## My Changes

- Added a responsive menu dropdown to accommodate more menu items and keep styles on smaller phone screens.
- Created different sidebar and footer social media profile links, like Google Scholar.
- Fixed the tag component in the blog page. But I haven't fully tested it yet. It should work!

## Roadmap
- Add more academic links, like _dblp_ in the future. I haven't find proper SVG for their icon yet.
- Add News page and display latest ones in the home page.
